# User Defined Matrix Library

We know that matrices have wide applications in engineering, physics, economics, and statistics, as well as in various branches of mathematics. So, we need to various types of matrices and terms of matrices for these applications. But, matrices have complicated operations to check matrices and to compute the matrix's terms. For this purpose, we create a library which checks the type of matrices and calculate the terms of matrices easily.
